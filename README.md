# Perceptron-Assignment-
Assignment for AI: STATISTICAL LEARNING &amp; PREDICTION. 

The objective for this assignment was to generate a random dataset which is separated into two categories based on the side it finds itself on with a random like. Think of a perceptron as a mini brain cell that helps an algorithm learn and make decisions. The perceptron, or PLA, learns based on how it correctly identifies the category the data points  belong to.
